# stardb-exporter

## Instructions

Download and install the [Npcap Installer](https://npcap.com/#download).

Go to the latest run [here](https://github.com/juliuskreutz/stardb-exporter/actions/workflows/build.yml) and scroll down to download `stardb-exporter.zip` and extract it (to a folder prefereably).

Launch the game until the point, where you are right before going into hyper speed. \
Execute the exporter and wait for it to say `All ready~!`. \
Go into hyperspeed and it should create the `export.json` file.

You can now import this file [here](https://stardb.gg/en/achievement-tracker/import).
