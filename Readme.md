# hsr-exporter

## Usage

Go to the latest run [here](https://github.com/juliuskreutz/stardb-exporter/actions/workflows/build.yml) and scroll down to download `stardb-exporter.zip` and extract it (to a folder prefereably).

Launch the game until the paint, where you are right before going into hyper speed. Execute the exporter and wait for it to say `All ready~!`.
Go into hyperspeed and it should create the `export.json` file.
